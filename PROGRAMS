PROGRAMS
========

This file lists the programs which are installed by running `make' in the root
directory and what each of them does.

In general, programs starting with CIJ_ operate on one or more sets of 36
elastic constants, or a .ecs file containing the constants.

Programs beginning with EC_grid operate on a special binary grid format,
containing 3D volumes of elastic constants.

Programs which operate on EC_grid-format sets of constants in a 3D volume
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where the program has a '_bin' in the name, it is designed to work with binary-
format EC_grid files.  Otherwise, ASCII files are used.

        Convert an ASCII EC_grid file to a binary one
EC_grid_bin2asc
        Convert a binary EC_grid file to an ASCII one
EC_grid_edit_bin

        file

        Divide by some number (usually density) the elastic constants at all
        points in a binary EC_grid file
EC_grid_plot_bin
        Create a plot of a binary EC_grid file
